# Magic Quadrant

[Magic Quadrant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Quadrant) is a scatter chart develop by Gartner to visualize major players in a specific market. You can find the sample magic quadrant for Cloud Providers in this [link](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-named-as-a-cloud-leader-for-the-10th-consecutive-year-in-gartners-infrastructure-platform-services-magic-quadrant/).
Magic Quadrant has two axes:

1.  X-axis (Completeness of Vision): represents relative innovation level.
2.  Y-axis (Ability to Execute): represents relative financial maturity.
